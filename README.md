## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to make an FAQ accordion and to get it to function using JavaScript using the if, else, and forEach function along with the parentNode as well.

### Continued development

I want to be able to use more of Flexbox and grid for the CSS and to get a better understanding of JavaScript.

### Useful resources

- [Responsive FAQ accordion dropdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB4qM9Umzss&list=PLM7UVNKcUioIFtGTKs19_uikSV-3WQe0Y&index=75&ab_channel=SamCodes) - This helped me for the FAQ accordion JavaScript section. I had already created the HTML and CSS, but was having trouble getting the accordion to work and this video helped me to understand what I needed to do.

### Updated November 17th, 2021

Fixed the FAQ accordion card size for the desktop 1440px.
